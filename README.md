# FAQ
1. The reference doesn't seem to exist. What's causing the incorrect output? 

The research bot uses GPT 3.5, a large language model that may sometimes generate inaccurate information. It's always advisable to double-check the reference's existence on a reliable platform like Google Scholar to ensure its accuracy.

2. Why can't I access my past search history?

Currently, as the bot is in its beta version, a dependable session management system has not yet been implemented for users. However, please stay tuned for further updates on this matter.
